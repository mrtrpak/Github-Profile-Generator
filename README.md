# Github-Profile-Generator

## Synopsis
This application is designed so that a user is able to look up github accounts and get an overview of their profile. In it the user can see the bio, repo information, and location of the github username they searched.

## Getting Started
In the terminal run the index.js to start. First the user will be prompted to enter a github username. Then the user will be prompted to choose their favorite color. Once they do and hit enter to run the app a MD file will be generated. The name that appears on top will be in the color that they chose in the prompt.
